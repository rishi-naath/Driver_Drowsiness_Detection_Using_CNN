# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection_Using_CNN

**Driver drowsiness** is a critical factor contributing to road accidents, as it 
severely impairs attention, reaction time, and decision-making. Factors like long 
driving hours, lack of sleep, and monotonous road conditions make drivers more 
susceptible to fatigue, often leading to serious or fatal incidents blah blah blah bleh bleh blu blu blu........

The title sums it up

Instructions:
1. clone this repository via cmd:

   
                   cd your/directory/to/clone

                   git clone https://github.com/rishi-naath/Driver_Drowsiness_Detection_Using_CNN

3. after cloning, run:

                   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. then open the dataset links and download the dataset via kaggle

4. once done, specify the directory paths inside aiko (cnn_model(aiko)) and Driver_Drowsiness_Detection (DDD).

5. run the CNN model first so that it creates a fresh memory, and repeatedly train with both datasets (only one dataset can be trained at once, but memory stays) for better efficiency.

6. train the model with larger epochs, it'll stop in between from time to time, which is fine.

7. for better detection in DDD, focus over a moderately-lit area.
